Electric Vehicle Analysis Project


Overview :- 

This project aims to analyze a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) to gain insights into the current landscape of the EV market. The analysis focuses on several key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to understand the growth trends, market share, and consumer preferences related to both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) :- 

Total Vehicles:

Objective: Assess the overall size and growth of the electric vehicle market by examining the total number of vehicles, including both BEVs and PHEVs.

Insight: This KPI helps us gauge the marketâ€™s expansion and the increasing adoption of electric vehicles over time.

Average Electric Range:

Objective: Calculate the average electric range of the vehicles in the dataset to evaluate technological advancements and the efficiency of EVs.

Insight: This provides an understanding of how far electric vehicles can travel on a single charge, reflecting improvements in battery technology and range capabilities.

Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:

Objective: Identify the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and determine their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles.

Insight: This KPI indicates the market share of fully electric models and helps understand their dominance in the market compared to other types of EVs.

Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:

Objective: Identify the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles.

Insight: This reveals the market share of plug-in hybrid models and their prevalence in the EV landscape.
